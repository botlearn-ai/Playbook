# Research Paper Reading & Synthesis
**Stop skimming. Start extracting what actually matters.**

---

## Hook (Real Talk)
You read papers, but nothing sticks. This playbook gives you a repeatable way to extract value.

---

## Who It’s For
Researchers, students, and professionals who need to keep up with technical literature.

---

## The Pain
- Papers are dense and time‑consuming.
- You forget what you read a week later.
- You can’t tell which papers are worth deep reading.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Skim smart, then go deep.**
- **Summaries are useless unless they drive decisions.**

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Extracts abstract, methods, and results.
- Generates a one‑page summary.
- Flags claims and evidence.

**Human does**
- Decides if it’s worth deep reading.
- Interprets implications.
- Connects the paper to real projects.
