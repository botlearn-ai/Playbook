# I Can Read English. I Still Freeze in Meetings.
**The 20‑minute daily fix for professionals who need real workplace English.**

---

## Hook (Real Talk)
You understand the meeting. You even know the words.
But when it’s your turn to speak, you freeze. This playbook fixes that.

---

## Who It’s For
Non‑native professionals who work in global teams and need clear, confident spoken English for:
- weekly updates
- client calls
- cross‑team coordination
- Q&A under pressure

---

## The Pain (You’re not alone)
- You can read everything, but can’t say it smoothly.
- Your tone sounds too direct or too weak.
- You feel slow in real‑time conversations.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **Right‑level challenge (ZPD):** Learn fastest when tasks are just slightly harder than your current level.
- **Self‑regulated learning (SRL):** Plan, practice, and reflect so each session gets better than the last.

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Generates realistic workplace scenarios.
- Roleplays with you and gives corrections.
- Refines tone, clarity, and structure.

**Human does**
- Picks the scenario.
- Speaks out loud.
- Keeps the final voice and intent.

---

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Pick (3 min)**
Choose one scenario for today: stand‑up update, status report, conflict resolution, or client call.

**2) Roleplay (12 min)**
Speak it out loud. The agent plays the counterpart and fixes grammar, tone, and structure.

**3) Rewrite (5 min)**
Rewrite the same message in a stronger, clearer version. Save it as a reusable template.

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** handle 1 workplace scenario without freezing.
- **14 days:** speak confidently across 3 scenarios.
- **30 days:** build a personal “workplace English script library.”
