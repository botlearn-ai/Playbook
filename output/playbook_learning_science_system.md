# Learning Science‑Driven Study System
**A simple system built on how learning actually works.**

---

## Hook (Real Talk)
Most study plans ignore how the brain learns. This playbook doesn’t.

---

## Who It’s For
Anyone who wants a reliable, science‑based learning system that scales.

---

## The Pain
- You study hard but forget quickly.
- You don’t know why some methods work and others fail.
- You keep starting over.

---

## The Simple Learning Logic
- **ZPD:** challenge just beyond comfort.
- **CLT:** reduce cognitive overload.
- **SRL:** plan, monitor, reflect.

---

## The Human‑Agent Split
**Agent does**
- Adjusts difficulty and pacing.
- Breaks content into chunks.
- Prompts reflection and review.

**Human does**
- Sets goals and priorities.
- Commits to consistent practice.
- Decides what matters most.

## The 3‑Step Routine (20 min/day)
**1) Plan (3 min)**
Set one learning goal for today.

**2) Learn (12 min)**
Study a chunk sized for your attention and ability.

**3) Reflect (5 min)**
Answer: what did I learn, and what still confuses me?

---

## Expected Outcomes (Time‑boxed)
- **7 days:** clearer learning routine.
- **14 days:** better retention and confidence.
- **30 days:** a system you can reuse forever.
